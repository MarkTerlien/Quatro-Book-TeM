    "Aerial images cover the entire globe at various spatial and temporal resolutions. Timely extraction of information from aerial images requires automated analysis to train computers to recognize what the human eye immediately identifies. Object-based image analysis (OBIA) improves processing efficiency by implementing image segmentation algorithms to combine groups of pixels into objects (segments) reducing the amount of information in and image. This article describes how to use open source Python packages to perform image segmentation and land cover classification of an aerial image. Specifically, I will demonstrate the process of geographic object-based image analysis (GeOBIA)to perform supervised land cover classification in 5 steps:\n",

    "Image segmentation is a method in which a digital image is broken down into various subgroups called Image segments which helps in reducing the complexity of the image to make further processing or analysis of the image simpler. Segmentation in easy words is assigning labels to pixels. All picture elements or pixels belonging to the same category have a common label assigned to them. \n",

    "This is the meat of the analysis. The classification algorithm. First, identify and label the training objects (lines 1–20). This process involves associating a label (land cover type) with the statistics describing each spectral band within the image segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, everything is now set up to train a classifier and use it to predict across all segments in the image. Here I’m using random forests, a popular classification algorithm. The code to train (fit) the algorithm and make predictions is quite simple (lines 22–24). Simply pass the training objects (containing the spectral properties) and the associated land cover label to the classifier. Once the classifier is trained (fitted) predictions can be made for non-training segments based on their spectral properties. After the predictions are made, save them to raster for display in a GIS (lines 26–43)."
